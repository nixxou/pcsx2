# PCSX2 LightGun Edition

A custom build of PCSX2 made for LightGun Games
Only for guncon2 games, It will not solve the issue for Silent Scope.
Priorize US versions of games, EU will work, but some will have less features (recoil), miss some interesting patch...

Game Specific notes :
For 2 player Vampire Night, i had issue with calibrating 2nd gun, so you need to boot with gun 2 off, and activate it once in game.
For endgame, remember that gun2 = player 1 and gun1 = player2
For RE Gun Survivor 2, you have to bypass the qualibration screen, don't calibrate the gun.

ChangeLog :
- MameHooker and Direct Gun4IR recoil support
- Aim Fix for few games (Resident Evil Survivor 2, Starsky & Hutch (E))
- 2 players Aim fix for Time Crisis 2 and Time Crisis 3
- Build in cheats and configuration to fix some issue, remove some gunflash...
- Some extra stuff like per game reshade profile, autoload savestate 10 on start, reduce the pause menu size to fill in 4:3 if it's the display mode...
